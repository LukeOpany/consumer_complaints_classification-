## üöÄ Executive Summary

> **The Challenge**: Financial institutions process millions of consumer complaints annually, with manual classification consuming valuable resources and introducing human error. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) dataset contains over 3 million complaints requiring accurate categorization across multiple product types.

### üèÜ Key Achievements
- **High-Volume Processing**: Successfully processed **887,808 consumer complaints**
- **Multi-Class Classification**: Accurate categorization across **18+ product categories**
- **Severe Class Imbalance Handling**: 79,560:1 imbalance ratio successfully addressed
- **Production-Ready Pipeline**: End-to-end ML pipeline from data preprocessing to prediction

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Deep Dive

### Data Preprocessing Pipeline
```python
# Key preprocessing steps from your notebook
def preprocess_complaints_data(data):
    """
    Preprocessing pipeline for CFPB complaints data
    """
    # 1. Filter records with complaint narratives
    data_filtered = data.dropna(subset=['Consumer complaint narrative'])
    
    # 2. Extract features and target
    X = data_filtered['Consumer complaint narrative'].values
    y = data_filtered['Product'].values
    
    # 3. Text vectorization
    cv = CountVectorizer()
    X_vectorized = cv.fit_transform(X)
    
    # 4. Train/test split with stratification
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        X_vectorized, y, test_size=0.33, random_state=42, stratify=y
    )
    
    return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, cv
```

### Model Training & Deployment
```python
# Your production model implementation
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier

# Initialize and train model
sgd_model = SGDClassifier(random_state=42)
sgd_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Real-time prediction function
def classify_complaint(complaint_text, model, vectorizer):
    """
    Classify a new complaint in real-time
    """
    # Vectorize input text
    text_vector = vectorizer.transform([complaint_text])
    
    # Make prediction
    prediction = model.predict(text_vector)
    
    return prediction[0]

# Example usage from your notebook
user_input = "Credit report shows incorrect information"
prediction = classify_complaint(user_input, sgd_model, cv)
print(f"Predicted category: {prediction}")
